**Problem Statement:**

Adidas, a global leader in the sportswear industry, has collected comprehensive data on sales across various channels in the United States during the years 2020 and 2021. The company is eager to gain valuable insights from this dataset to inform strategic decisions and enhance its market position. The primary objective is to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs) that can help Adidas better understand its sales dynamics in the US market. Adidas corporate executives, Senior Management, Financial analysts and Investors are the primary stakeholders as they closely monitor the sales performance to assess the company's financial health and make investment decisions.

**Project Scope:**

1. **Data Collection:**

- The dataset includes sales data from Adidas stores, online platforms, and third-party retailers across the United States.
- Information spans the years 2020 and 2021, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance over this period.

2. **Key Questions to Address:**

- Identify and analyze sales trends for different product categories.
- Evaluate the impact of external factors (e.g., economic conditions, global events) on sales.
- Explore seasonality effects on sales and identify peak periods.
- Compare the performance of various sales channels, including Adidas stores, online platforms, and third-party retailers.

3. **KPI's:**

- Total Revenue
- Year-over-Year Growth
- Operating margin

4. **Recommendations and Actionable Insights:**

- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
- Suggest potential areas for improvement or optimization in the sales strategy.


**OUTCOMES AND SUMMARIZED INSIGHTS:**
The following insights are a summary of the outcome in the querries in this document.
-In-Store Sales in 2020 had a slowdown in 2021. While Online Sales represented more of the Overall sales in 2021. This could be primarily because of the begining of the Covid Pandemic.
-Sales in 2020 came mostly on Fridays(16.39%) and in 2021 the sales were slightly higher during Tuesdays (15.3%) and Thursdays(15.32%). This could also be because of the same shift to online sales. Stores could have deals on different days depending if the marketing team wants to focus on covering the sales on the days Adidas sells less or if Adidas wants to capitalize on the days they sell more.
-In terms of seasonality the sales tended to be slighlty less at the very end of the year (November-December), The beginning of 2020 had much higher sales compared to the end possibly due to the economic problems caused by the Covid Pandemic. In 2021 the sales were more stable throughout the year, with a small slowdowns in February and November.
-Men buy more Adidas Shoe products 40.2% of sales (specially Street wear 23.2%), while Women tend to buy more the Apparel aspect of Adidas 19.8% of all sales.
-New York, California, and Florida were the overall Top 3 States based on units sold.
-Revenue was considerably higher from the retailers WestGear and Footlocker.







**Adidas queries**

The following queries take into account the KPI's for this project and intend to gather insight based on said KPI's in order to address Key Questions.

SELECTSUM(Total\_Sales)AS Total\_Revenue FROM adidas\_us

- Right away I wanted to know the Total Revenue so I started with the simple SUM Query. This number could give me a little bit more information into other aspects later on.





â€“ Created a CTE that will help get the date in a format that can be worked with, and if needed the CTE can be modified for other purposes later.

)

SELECT\*

FROM SalesCTE

- I decided to create a CTE that I can work with from the beginning because I can slowly build it up based on the progress of the project. A CTE allows me to keep the code fairly clean, while also "creating" "temporary tables" that have different information than the original one. If a project has multiple tables to work with, this simplifies queries that involve multiple joins and is less confusing if worked in the beginning.

- Following up, I wanted to know the total units sold in each year. This will allow me to later move on into revenue by year and have this piece of information that tells us about our KPI's, as well as helping us analyze trends and seasonality.

- Here I wanted to Understand a little bit more of what Sales Methods were most popular yearly. We can see that the Outlet Sales for 2020 represent 47.29% of all sales in that year compared to 31.29% in 2021. While Online Sales represent 18.83% of all sales in 2020, in 2021 this number went to 42.25%. In-Store Sales represent 33.86% of all sales in 2020, in 2021 26.45%.

- Here I was a little bit curious of what days sell more units, and if by any chance there was a day that had numbers that could give us insights. Here are the following %.

-Monday 13.15%--------------------------------(2021)Monday: 12.58%

-(2020)Tuesday 14.44%-----------------------------(2021)Tuesday: 15.3%

-(2020)Wednesday 14.39%------------------------(2021)Wednesday: 14.02%

-(2020)Thursday 13.58%---------------------------(2021)Thursday: 15.32%

-(2020)Sunday 14.65%------------------------------(2021) Sunday: 13.74%

-We can see that there were more sales on Friday during 2020, but on 2021 there was more sales on Tuesday and Thursday. The explanation could be related to the transition from In-store/Outlet, to Online that happened in those years.

- I was also curious about splitting it by month, because it allows us to understand how the trend works in relation of seasonality. Here are the %

-January 10.45%(2020)-----------------------8.89% (2021)

-February 8.18%(2020)-----------------------7.74% (2021)

-November 5.44%(2020)---------------------7.40% (2021)

-December4.44%(2020)-----------------------8.49% (2021)

The information gathered based on months, is specially interesting in 2020 where we see in the months from January to May, where we see stability in the % of sales, but afterwards we start to see big variability on the sales each month. In this case is easy to interpret that since the COVID pandemic started in the beginning of 2020, the spending was normal at the beginning of the year, but later on doubts about general economic stability could have hurt the sales. In 2021 where the sales are around 4 times larger than 2020, the economic situation was also more stable, which could potentially explain why the sales were also stable.

-- Its possible to see the following data only for 2020 and 2021, just adding WHERE YEAR()= in between FROM and GROUP BY, and after the FORM in the / (the difference in year didn't drive into any insights)

SELECT Product,SUM(Total\_Sales)\*100/(SELECTSUM(Total\_Sales)from SalesCTE)AS PCT

FROM SalesCTE

GROUPBY Product

ORDERBY PCT DESC;

- This time I'm jumping directly into what products drive the biggest revenue (% PCT) and we can see that generally speaking Men's Street Footwear drives more revenue than others, followed by Women's Apparel and Men's Athletic Footwear. Which indicates that Men tend to focus more on the Shoes aspect (specially Street Footwear), and Women's tend to use adidas more as a apparel brand.
