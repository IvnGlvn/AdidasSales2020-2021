# AdidasSales2020-2021
This is the folder for a project that I worked for the purpouse of building a portfolio.
Im currently not familiar with how to use GitHub in its totality.

The Folder Contains a .md file where its the SQL code Ive written for the Analysis, and there is another folder for Images of the results of those queries.
Also it contains the Dataset I've worked with. That dataset might be a little small for SQL, but the intent was to show my skills in that program.
THE FOLLOWING LINK IS THE FINAL DATA VIZ FOR THE PRESENTATION FOR THE PROJECT AND IS INTENDED TO BE SHOWN ALONGSIDE FINDINGS IN THE SLQ QUERY. https://public.tableau.com/views/Adidas_Sales_Report20202021/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
